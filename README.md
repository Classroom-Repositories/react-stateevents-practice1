# react-stateevents-practice1

- You have a regular component called `DogCard`, a container component called `DogsList`, an `App` component, and a `dogs.js` file that is exporting an array of objects
- On the DOM your application should show a list of dog images and a button for each image that says `"Bark"`
- When a User clicks on the `"Bark"` button it should render an `h3` to the screen with textContent `"Bark"`
- When a User clicks on the button a second time the `h3` should be removed from the DOM

# What are we practicing?

- Making decisions about when we need state and which component should hold state
- Learning and mapping component hierarchy
- mapping through an array to render a list of components
- setState
- Event Handling in React
